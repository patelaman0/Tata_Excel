**Why This Project Was Created**

My work involves managing images, and I often needed to rename them according to their content before downloading. To eliminate the manual renaming process, I built this system where users can upload images, and the system organizes them without requiring manual name changes. This saves time and ensures consistency in file management.

Image upload functionality

Automated organization of images

Direct download of images without manual renaming
